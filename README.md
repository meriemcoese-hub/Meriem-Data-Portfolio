# Meriem Data Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio. This repository contains four projects that demonstrate my ability to explore data, build models, and communicate insights.

## Projects

1. **Inside Airbnb: Pricing & Trends in Paris**  
   I analysed synthetic Airbnb listings in Paris to uncover pricing patterns by neighbourhood, room type, and season. Using pandas for data wrangling, I computed summary statistics and visualised the results with bar charts. The key insight is that central arrondissements command higher prices while demand spikes around holiday periods.

2. **How TikTok Works: What Drives Reach in 2025**  
   This project dissects a hypothetical TikTok dataset to see how factors like caption length, hashtag count, sound popularity and posting time affect views and engagement. I used scatter plots to explore relationships and built a simple regression model to measure feature influence.

3. **Why Customers Leave: A Dataâ€¯Driven Churn Analysis**  
   I created a mock dataset of subscription churn and trained a logistic regression model to classify customers as likely to churn or stay. The notebook walks through data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation with metrics like accuracy and recall, and includes a confusion matrix.

4. **What Recruiters Want: A Data Analyst Job Market Study**  
   I scraped a collection of data analyst job postings to identify common skill requirements (Python, SQL, Excel, machine learning) and salary ranges. The analysis summarises trends with bar charts and highlights which skills are most in demand.

## How to use this portfolio
